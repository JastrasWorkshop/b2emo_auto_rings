# b2emo_auto_rings
This repository contains the information for my automatic body rings for my b2emo droid. Updated as of 15JUN25

It uses an Arduino Nano as the brain and runs a real simple code to select one or both motors to spin:
-a random direction
-a random speed
-for a random amount of time

And then waits between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds before looping and running again.

This make a very simple animation that seems more organic, as it never 'repeats'.

You can find the IDE code in the b2_auto_ring_spin_code.txt just copy and paste it, then upload it to your chip (I'm using a Nano simply for size).
There is a simple bill of materials that outlines what components you need.
