Arduino Nano: I use an Elegoo clone sourced from Amazon. Got 3 chips for about $15US.
L298N Motor Controller: I used a ShillehTek version of this chip, but any version should work. This will most likely be replaced eventually with a Cytron MDD10A just for efficiency, but the L298N works great.
12V Power Supply: This needs to connect to the Motor Controller to power the motors. In testing, I'm just using a Bench Power Supply but will eventually use a LiPo Battery
5V Power Supply: This will connect to the Nano. I am using the 8.4V that are coming off of my Pololu Maestro, and so it is going directly into the VIN pin on the Nano. This seems to work just fine.
Wago 3-pin Connector: Any connector will do, this is primarily to ensure both the Nano and the L298N share a common ground. Very important.
Various jumper cables and wires: You'll need to connect the pins on the Nano to the pins on the L298N, having a good mix of these will be useful. I plan to have these two chips pretty close together and so they don't need to be very long.
